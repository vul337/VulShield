# README


This repo contains the source code of our NDSS'25 paper "VulShield: Protecting Vulnerable Code Before Deploying Patches".

This work is part of Dr. Li Yuan's research during her PhD. She has successfully graduated and started working. During her spare time, she will be organizing the code from her thesis. Most of the code (or all) will be open-sourced around NDSS 2025. 

Currently, the code of the policy enforcer, the public key of signature verification, the motivation example and the raw data for performance testing have been uploaded. 

This project adds how to reproduce the **data race vulnerability** reported by syzbot (**ID: syzbot-a834b993**). Since syzbot did not provide a working PoC, this repository provides the necessary materials and steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
